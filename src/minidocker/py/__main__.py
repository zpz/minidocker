'''
``python3 -m minidocker.py build`` builds a Docker image for Python code development in this repo.
This command handles two scenarios, namely, the repo develops a Python "package" or a Python "project".

In the case of a Python "package", it is assumed that (1) the package's dependencies are all specified in
``pyproject.toml``, and (2) there is no Dockerfile in the repo.

In the case of a Python "project", it is assumed that (1) the file ``pyproject.toml`` in the repo does not
specify **any** dependency; (2) there exists subdirectory ``docker`` under the root of the repo, and
the subdirectory contains ``Dockerfile`` as well as any dependencies needed for building the Docker image;
the process of building the Docker image does not make use of anything outside of the subdirectory ``docker``.
