If you do it manually, in principle you can create a directory `.githooks` in the root directory of the repo, and copy the hook files in this directory into `.githooks`, and make the files executable. After that,
do the following in the root directory of the repo:

```
$ git config --local core.hooksPath .githooks/
```

This lets `git` know this custom directory contains hooks.
(The default hooks directory is `.git/hooks`.)

However, if you use `python3 -m minidocker.py build`, it will do the above for you.
If will not make copies of the actual hook files; rather, it will create links
to the original files in this `github` repo. See the current repo for example.

The hooks needs several Python packages. Make sure they are installed by `python3 -m pip install`.
